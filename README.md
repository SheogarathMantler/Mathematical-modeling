# Mathematical-modeling
Issues discussed during Mathematical Modeling course in ITMO, 2nd year

Task List:
1) To create your own fractal
2) To create random values' generator with preset distribution in order to model electron orbitals
3) Simulate string and memrane oscillations with unstable stiffness
4) investigate the behavior of the entanglement vector of two mathematical systems given by vectors in 2-dimensional Hilbert spaces
